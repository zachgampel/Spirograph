# Spirograph
Spirograph is an interactive way to draw and discover new spirograph patterns.
This is the third mini-project I made as I learned C++ and SFML.

## Features
    Interactive information displayed on left-hand-side.
    Change line segment radius and angular velocity using the arrow keys and cursor.
    Add or subtract line segments by pressing CTRL+UP or CTRL+DOWN.
    Speed up or slow down using the arrow keys.
    Zoom in and out using the scroll wheel.
    Move around by holding down left-click and moving the cursor.
    Change the drawn colors by pressing 'C'.
    Refresh the drawing by pressing SPACE.
